# Sprite Motion Studio
Sprite Motion Studio is an interactive playground for animating sprites by adding motion instructions. Users can create multiple sprites, and customize their motion parameters (like speed, direction, and rotation), and the sprites animate in real-time based on the defined values. This tool simplifies the process of creating sprite-based animations by offering a visual, code-free interface.
